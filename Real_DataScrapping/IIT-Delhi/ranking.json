One possibility is that the institute has not been able to keep pace with the rising standards of other top universities around the world. Another possibility is that the institute has not been able to attract as many top-quality faculty and students as it did in the past. Despite the ranking decline, IIT Delhi remains one of the top engineering and technology institutes in India. The institute offers a wide range of undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs in engineering, science, and technology. IIT Delhi also has a strong research reputation, and its faculty members have produced many notable research publications."
