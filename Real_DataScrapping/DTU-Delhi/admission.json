Therefore, getting into B.Tech courses at DTU is difficult with a JEE Main percentile score of 90 or below. The cutoff also goes high and low every year, depending on the following factors: Number of aspirants registered, The difficulty level of the exam, Total number of seats available, total number of applications received for a particular program, and the category under which admission is sought. Therefore, it is very difficult to predict the exact cutoff and give an exact answer to this question."

The admission requirements seem daunting, but don't worry, I'm here to guide you through it all! First things first, to be eligible for admission to DTU's undergraduate engineering programs, you need to take the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Main and JEE Advanced. These exams test your knowledge in subjects like Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics, and are a critical component of the selection process. But wait, there's more! If you're interested in pursuing a Master of Technology (M.Tech) degree, you need to take the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) and score well. This exam tests your understanding of technical subjects like engineering, Science, and mathematics. And for those of you looking to pursue a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D. ) degree, DTU conducts its entrance examination. The exam is designed to test your aptitude, research skills, and domain knowledge. So, whether you're a high school student aspiring to be an engineer, or a graduate looking to further your education, DTU has a programme for you.

The cutoff for VIPS BBA varies every year, depending on the number of applicants, the difficulty level of the entrance exam, and other factors. In 2021, the closing rank for BBA at VIPS for the general category (inside Delhi) was 391. So, if the cutoff remains similar this year, you may have a chance of getting admission. However, it is also possible that the cutoff will be higher, in which case you may not be able to get in. Here are some factors that could affect the cutoff for VIPS BBA in 2023: The number of applicants: If there are more applicants this year than last year, the cutoff is likely to be higher. The difficulty level of the entrance exam: If the entrance exam is more difficult this year than last year, the cutoff is likely to be lower. The performance of other colleges: If other colleges in Delhi have higher cutoffs for BBA, VIPS may also have a higher cutoff to attract students. The best way to know for sure whether you will be able to get into VIPS with a rank of 3044 (inside Delhi) for BBA is to wait for the cutoff to be released. You can check the cutoff on the website of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (GGSIPU) once it is released."
