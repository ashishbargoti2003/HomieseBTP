The cutoff for VIPS BBA varies every year, depending on the number of applicants, the difficulty level of the entrance exam, and other factors. In 2021, the closing rank for BBA at VIPS for the general category (inside Delhi) was 391. So, if the cutoff remains similar this year, you may have a chance of getting admission. However, it is also possible that the cutoff will be higher, in which case you may not be able to get in. Here are some factors that could affect the cutoff for VIPS BBA in 2023: The number of applicants: If there are more applicants this year than last year, the cutoff is likely to be higher. The difficulty level of the entrance exam: If the entrance exam is more difficult this year than last year, the cutoff is likely to be lower. The performance of other colleges: If other colleges in Delhi have higher cutoffs for BBA, VIPS may also have a higher cutoff to attract students. The best way to know for sure whether you will be able to get into VIPS with a rank of 3044 (inside Delhi) for BBA is to wait for the cutoff to be released. You can check the cutoff on the website of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (GGSIPU) once it is released."
