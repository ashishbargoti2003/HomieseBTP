There is no amazing course curriculum.   Placements :   To be honest, on-campus placements lie between 60-70%. The average package is 20 LPA and it goes up to 1 crore per month if converted internships to PPOs. The top recruiting company was Nvidia last year. Many top companies visit our college. Internships are basically provided in the third year.   Infrastructure :   Hostel facilities are top. There are no limitations on time. We can go out whenever we want and we just need to do entry and exists. Sports facilities are available 24 hours. The canteen is open 24 hours along with one Nescafe both of which are open 24 hours which is near hostels. Hostels are comfortable with good Wi-Fi.   Faculty :   Teachers are highly qualified but we get problems in understanding. The course curriculum is highly tough. Semester exams are very tough. The pass percentage depends on the course. Sometimes, it is too good and sometimes it is too bad. There is a proper system to communicate with teachers.

The highest package this year is 51 LPA, and the average package is around 25 LPA. Most students get placed in all branches except CSSS.   Infrastructure :   Labs and classrooms are better than those in most colleges since they are new. The entire campus is equipped with Wi-Fi facility. Mess food is decent and better than that of other NITs or DTU. The library has three floors with different study rooms. Sports and games facilities are not very good. Hostels are the best.

Placements :   Due to strict eligibility criteria, many students don’t get placed and are often not allowed to sit for placements. These students are not included in the placement statistics, which leads the college to report a placement rate of 98.81%. For example, TCS recently visited the campus and set a minimum eligibility criterion of 8.5 CGPA, offering a package of 4.5 LPA. The highest packages go up to crores, but these are typically for overseas placements. Most domestic placements offer an in-hand salary of approximately 1 lakh per month. Due to a current low demand for engineers, placements have reached an all-time low. Nevertheless, maintaining a CGPA of 7+ can still help secure a placement, while a 7.5/8+ CGPA is recommended for internships.   Infrastructure :   The hostel facilities are excellent, offering well-equipped rooms with a bed (no mattress), a table with drawers, overhead storage, a wooden slab, and an almirah. Common amenities include a fridge and microwave on the ground floor of each hostel, along with a common room furnished with a foosball table, sofas, tables, chairs, and a large TV for watching movies and shows. There are no curfew timings. Each floor has two washrooms on either side, with 4 toilets, 5 showers, and 3 washbasins. Washrooms are cleaned daily in the early morning, and additional cleaning can be requested at any time by contacting FMS. Although the mess food and canteen offerings are below average and barely edible, the campus infrastructure is impressive, with strong Wi-Fi connectivity available throughout, including in hostels. Classrooms, labs, and libraries are well-maintained, and the R&D block is beautiful and well-equipped with all the necessary facilities you would need during your four years here.   Faculty :   The courses are quite challenging, and passing is not easy. For example, the passing cutoff for the Probability and Statistics course in the second semester is set at 13%, yet many students still fail. Around 30-40% of students fail each course, and professors rarely lower the passing marks. You really need to study hard once you join this college, especially for end-semester exams, where the class average often falls between 10-15%. Scoring 40-50% is considered exceptionally high in these exams. Although the faculty members are experts in their respective fields, having obtained their PhDs from esteemed universities, many students still turn to online resources like YouTube to understand the course material, as the professors often struggle to explain concepts effectively.

Semester exams are generally challenging, but due to the emphasis on regular assessments, quizzes, mid-semester exams, and assignments, students view the difficulty as more of a fun challenge.   Other :   I choose this course particularly in this college due to its reputation in IT education, the overall industry relevance of the course, and my interest.
